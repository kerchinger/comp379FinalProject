#Meta-analysis of four published microarray datasets in systemic sclerosis  

Description: I have worked with a rare disease called systemic sclerosis few years ago. It has two clinical subtypes: limited form and diffused form. Disease severity is defined by skin score 0-51. Patients often have interstitial lung disease (ILD), which is major cause of mortality.  There are 4 microarray datasets from relative large clinical cohorts (GSE9285, GSE68698. GSE32413,  GSE58095, there are publications about each cohort, but results are not consistent). We will try to do meta-analysis of these data to find out if gene expression and other clinical characteristics can be used for disease prediction (subtype, severity, ILD).
